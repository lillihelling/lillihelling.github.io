_Welcome Home!_ was my thesis exhibition at SUNY New Paltz, receiving my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Ceramics.

## Artist Statement

Control of the distinct physical experiences of comfort and discomfort often comes from objects rather than ourselves. I remember being at a concert and needing to use the bathroom the whole time, and it ruined the entire experience. Certain objects control this comfort, yet they arenâ€™t the objects we appreciate in reference to our well-being. Once they are unavailable, their absence is immediately noticeable. By shifting scale, texture, and color, I force these unnoticed objects to become a spectacle. This recontextualizes them into a strange, yet almost familiar, still-life setting.
