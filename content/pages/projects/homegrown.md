## Artist Statement

My bedroom has always been a place of the upmost comfort and privacy. The furnishings often moved with me as I started over in each new bedroom, house, town, or state; they became the only consistencies in times of change. Like a silent supportive friend, they held me during times of happiness and distress. However, through mundane daily interactions, these familiar objects often fade into the background. In applying the pink glaze that coats the dioramas, I acknowledge my clouded memory of the furniture and rooms. As I recreate beloved furniture from my past and present, I am taking time to remember them and, in the process, bringing them into the spotlight. In this way, _home grown_ is meant to glorify these pieces that have mattered to me and reflect on the experiences and memories that surround them.
